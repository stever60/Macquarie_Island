Title

Updates to proxy data from Emerald Lake, Macquarie Island.

Abstract

The dataset comprises of updated proxy data from the Emerald Lake sediment record on Macquarie Island. Core scanning (ITRAX XRF) and multispectral data (SPECIM) originally published in Saunders et al. (2018) have been updated to the 2020 radiocarbon calibration curve. Updates are published in:

Lineage/methodology

A series of lake sediment cores dating back to c. 12.1 ka BP were extracted from Emerald Lake on the west coast of sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. We applied three independent methods to reconstruct past changes in SHW intensity. 
To reconstruct past sea salt aerosol inputs, we developed a method to track past changes in lake water conductivity (a function of sea salt aerosol input) using diatom-based inference models.
ITRAX XRF core scanning (XRFCS) analysis was used to track inputs of minerogenic aerosols into the lake, focusing on Ti as the most widely used indicator of allochthonous inputs 
Cores were scanned using a Specim hyperspectral camera, which measures reflected optical properties between wavelengths from 400-1000 nm. The ratio of reflectance between 850 and 900 nm (R850/R900) was used as an additional indicator of minerogenic inputs

We have updated the age depth model in Saunders et al. (2018) and applied this update to these datasets. Recalibration and age depth models have been updated to 2020 calibration curves (Sh20) in the R package BACON v. 2.5 for Bayesian age-depth modelling (Blaauw and Christen, 2011).
